WHY FUZZING AMD ATTACKS

Why Do Security Testers Fuzz Directories?

Directory fuzzing is the process of sending many requests to a target web server using wordlists (common or custom) to discover hidden or unlinked files, folders, and endpoints.

Goals of Directory Fuzzing

1. Find sensitive files

.env, config.php, database.yml, .git/

These may contain API keys, credentials, or source code.



2. Uncover hidden admin panels or dashboards

/admin, /secret, /manage

Could allow unauthorized access if not properly protected.



3. Detect backup or old files

index.php.bak, login.old, db_backup.zip

Often left by developers accidentally.



4. Identify new API endpoints

/api/v1/users, /beta, /internal

Could be used for privilege escalation or logic flaws.



5. Help with other attacks

Brute force attacks (find login panels to test passwords)

LFI/RFI (find file inclusion points)

RCE (find scripts that execute code, like test pages)

Data leakage (exposed directories, logs, debugging endpoints)

Privilege escalation (hidden admin routes not meant for public)

Which Attacks Can Directory Fuzzing Enable?

Information Disclosure → Exposed configuration or source files

Broken Access Control → Accessing admin endpoints without login

Remote Code Execution (RCE) → Upload folders with weak validation

Local File Inclusion (LFI) → Test endpoints that allow file loading

API Abuse → Hidden endpoints with sensitive operations

Data Breaches → Finding backups containing raw databases
